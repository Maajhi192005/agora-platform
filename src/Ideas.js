  definition: [
    'In Platonic philosophy, Ideas or Forms (á¼¸Î´Î­Î±Î¹) are the perfect, eternal, and unchanging templates of which the things we perceive in the physical world are imperfect copies. The Idea of a circle, for instance, is perfect and eternal, while any drawn circle is merely an approximation.',
    'Ideas exist in a realm beyond the physicalâ€”accessible not through the senses but through reason and intellectual contemplation. This "Theory of Forms" suggests that true knowledge is knowledge of these eternal Ideas, not of the changing, imperfect material world.',
    'Understanding Ideas involves recognizing the difference between appearance and reality, between the shadows on the cave wall and the objects casting those shadows in the sunlight.'
